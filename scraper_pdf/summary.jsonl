The process is awaiting judgment, and the prospect is that Sicredi will succeed in this demand, due to STJ\u2019s pronouncement in REsp n\u00ba 1696214 \/SP, which confirmed the thesis that the closing of an account used to sell cryptocurrencies does not constitute an abusive practice. In 2019, there was a partial decision, authorizing Sicredi to close the account, with the condition that CoinBR be notified of the closure, so that it seeks to evaluate other solutions available in the financial market, to execute their financial operations. The process is awaiting judgment of an appeal filed by CoinBR.b) As a result of the above process, the preparatory procedure for administrative inquiry No. 08700.003599\/2018- 95 was initiated before the Administrative Council for Economic Defense (CADE), for alleged anti-competitive practices\/unfair competition in the face of cryptocurrency brokers, whose opening was caused by representation by the Brazilian Association of Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain - ABCB, initially in face of Banco do Brasil S.A. Sicredi responded to all requests for information made by the economic defense agency. There is still no final decision on the preparatory procedure. The latest information, on 10\/31\/2019, is that the suspension was extended for another 180 days, to continue the investigation."}

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people. For this reason, the report does not bring a comparison with previous years."}

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people.

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people.

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people.

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people.

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people.

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people.

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people. For this reason, the report does not bring a comparison with previous years."}

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people.

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people.

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people. For this reason, the report does not bring a comparison with previous years."}

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people.

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people. For this reason, the report does not bring a comparison with previous years."}

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people.

This way, we validate that the supplier is not systemic. By means of this change in methodology, we also started to count the purchases of credit unions located in the big cities, differently from previous years, when we considered only cities with less than 200 thousand people. For this reason, the report does not bring a comparison with previous years."}
