{"Filename":"2017_CBA_EN.jsonl","GRI":"413-2","Text":"| Our industrial and mining operations are located in municipalities in the interior of the states of S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo (plant) and Minas Gerais. The identified socio-environmental and economic impacts on the local communities of these territories are distinct, due to the different activities that we conduct in each locality. In the communities impacted by the mining activities, the main environmental impacts identified relate to deforestation to create space for the mining operation and dust caused by the movement of trucks transporting bauxite. To mitigate the impacts of the removal of vegetation for the extraction of the ore, we have a program to rehabilitate and recover the mined areas, developed in partnership with local universities, which guarantees that the soil is returned in good physical and chemical conditions for planting coffee, eucalyptus or pasture, or for the recomposition of the native vegetation (find out more about how we operate, on page 33). To mitigate dust levels, we have the practice of dampening the earth tracks used by the trucks loaded with bauxite and the mining machines. This dampening procedure is done using water tank trucks. Also, around the mines, we have equipment that control the air quality continually, enabling timely actions to be carried out in critical situations. To inform the local populations about our good management practices, we have developed an Environmental Education Program (EEP), with educational actions for the internal and external publics (see more on page 32). In the municipality of Alum\u221a\u2260nio, where our plant is located, we identified that one of the main impacts of our activities is the risk of economic dependence on the plant. To mitigate this risk, we invested in social projects that help to empower the local population. One such project is the ReDes Program, which promotes the strengthening of inclusive production chains capable of generating income for the community (see more on page 56). In terms of environmental impacts, the main aspects highlighted by the communities relate to the pruning of trees and conservation of areas of native forest that exist around the factory. We have a team that seeks to carry out this work in preventative form, but we also seek to act promptly when we receive notices and alerts from local residents. The communities impacted by our activities can access, via the institutional website of CBA, a communication channel where they can submit complaints. Other forms of learning about and evaluating the demands of society are reports received directly by the units, which are forwarded to the areas responsible, so that the necessary measures can be taken.419-1 | Amounts paid out in fines, infractions and judicial decisions relating to socio- economic aspects totaled R$19.1 million; of this figure, 99.6% relates to agreements and compensations for labor-related lawsuits.
