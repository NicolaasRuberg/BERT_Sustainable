Since then, profits have been steadily rising, hitting a new record in 2016 with a total of R$ 38.2 million. In Brazil, the figure reached R$ 23.7 million, while the volume amounted to R$ 14.5 million in International Operations. Our consultants are the real stars of this movement in favor of education, since they are the ones engaged in selling products from this line while waiving their own profits (as does Na- tura). In 2016, there were more than 1.5 million registered consultants in Brazil and in International Operations who sold at least one Crer para Ver prod- uct. It is important to stress that Bra- zilians also started to benefit from a structured project in support of edu- cation (read more about this initiative on page page 44 ). As it entered its fifth year of activity in 2015, the institute updated its strategic plan in an effort to make its initiatives even more transformative, and with long-term effects.

{"Filename":"2016_Natura_EN.jsonl","GRI":"203-1","Text":"The income received by the communities during the year exceeded R$ 10 million. That is 55% higher than the amount received in 2015 and, in ad- dition to payment for supplies (R$ 5.8 million), it included the sharing of benefits derived from access to traditional knowledge (R$ 3.07 million), support for community infrastructure, training and payment for use of their image.  We have measured the positive impacts created by our relationship with local families, such as income gen- eration through the purchase of in- puts, investment in developing higher value-added production chains and transfer of technical skills through the training we provide. Now that they are much better organized, the communi- ties are entering into partnerships with other companies, as well as Natura, to supply inputs obtained from the Brazil- ian biodiversity. This development was achieved using a sustainable produc- tion and commercial model. We have also invested in improving the productivity of these communities and adding value to their supplies, by upgrading the infrastructure of two extraction units (one in the Mid-Juru\u221a\u00b0 region and the other in the northeast of Par\u221a\u00b0) and thereby improving the quality to the oil and butter produced. We have continued with our training programs in the fields of health, safety, good management practices and or- ganization management, training 545 people in 2016. Also in 2016, 100% of supplier commu- nities were audited by our Socio-bio- diversity Chain Verification System, developed jointly with the UEBT (Union for Ethical Biotrade). This procedure looks into labor issues, organization management and good production practices, and ensures the tracking of production chains, which is one of our greatest challenges. This verification is ongoing, since the families need to de- velop a system to provide documenta- tion confirming the origin of all inputs. The audits are performed annually in each of the communities, generating action plans that are monitored until the next audit. Once a year, the communities partici- pate in the Qlicar Award - which distin- guishes Natura suppliers - in the Bio- Qlicar category. The award goes to the most noteworthy community, the one that has shown the greatest evolution in several categories revolving around quality and good practices. The BioQli- car ratings underwent some changes in 2016, and the calculation now takes into consideration the ratings provided by the Verification System, as well as an indi- cator that measures the planned volume of production and delivery deadline. The communities achieved a 3.93 rat- ing in 2016. This index, which used to be a part of BioQlicar but is now an element of the Verification System, ad- vanced slightly in comparison to the previous year\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s figure, of 3.62. The rat- ing is weighted, along with the OTIF (on time in full) assessment rating of the community. The improvement is due to the communities\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 improved audit rat- ings, as well as greater compliance with the action plans during 2016, which also increases the community\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s rating throughout the year. There was also an improvement in the OTIF rating, com- pared to 2015, due to better delivery planning, both by Natura and by the communities, and greater investment in chain infrastructure.56","Obs":"ok"}

All these actions aim at contributing to the establishment of a sustainable commercial model focused on the conservation of socio-biodiversity. No neg- ative impacts have been identified so far in the supplier communities with which Natura works. Direct investments are made in the form of payments for supplies, sharing of benefits and use of image, and are paid directly to each local community.

Among the indirect impacts of their relationship with Natu- ra are the development of production chains and improve- ment of skills of the populations involved, through training in health and safety programs, good management prac- tices and administrative and organizational management. Additionally, there is potential to create new opportunities and commercial partnerships, form a network of commu- nities and  knowledge exchange, focus on biodiversity con- servation and establish a commercial model focused on biodiversity that can influence stakeholders. In 2016, there was an increase in investments, mainly due to the abundant volume of inputs provided for soap pro- duction, leading to a greater need for investments in infra- structure and materials in the production chains; studies and technical services.","Obs":"ok"}

Plant species that are at risk of extinction, be they native to Brazil or exotic (imported and grown in Brazil) which are used in Natura product lines. Conservation projects are in place, in partnership with research institutions and direct suppliers, to protect the species from Brazilian biodiversity. For the Brazil nut and Paraguay tea, two conservation projects have been carried out, in partnership with Embrapa. Likewise, we have just concluded a conservation project, in partnership with UFSCar (Federal University of S\u221a\u00a3o Carlos) to protect ucuuba trees, by collecting its  fruit without cutting them down. We also support the adoption of agroforestry systems for the production of Brazil nuts, ucuuba and piri piri in communities in the Amazon. Paraguay tea is off the list of Brazilian flora that are at risk of extinction. On the other hand, piri piri has been placed, for the first time, on the list of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) and is a species whose organic chain was developed by Natura. The slash pine species of Pinus, used in fragrance formulas, is obtained from a planted forest whose origin is traceable, as guaranteed by the supplier. In the case of the shea tree, the supplier participates in the Global Shea Alliance, a movement aimed at promoting the sustainability of this production chain. As for candelilla and holy wood, both feature on the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) list, but the supplier complies with international legislation, and possesses the necessary CITES certification. The sandalwood comes from Sri Lanka, a country that follows strict species protection and conservation policies, and has its sourcing guaranteed by the supplier. Furthermore, we have received UEBT (Union for Ethical BioTrade) Certifications for 14 Amazon supplier communities, thereby reinforcing our commitment to ethical sourcing.","Obs":"ok"}
{"Filename":"2016_Natura_EN.jsonl","GRI":"304-2","Text":"SUPPLIER COMMUNITIES , , ,  Every year, we broaden and strength- en our relationship with the commu- nities that supply our natural inputs. We maintain links with 33 local com- munities, three of which were included in 2016. Together, they represent 2,841 families. Around 75% of these business partners are located in the Amazon region, totaling 27 communities and 2,119 families. The other communities we maintain relationships with are lo- cated in different parts of Brazil (see map showing the location of all suppli- er communities here ) Two of the three new supplier commu- nities are situated on Maraj\u221a\u2265 island (Par\u221a\u00b0 state), a new area of operations for Natura. These new partnerships were required to expand the sourcing of certain bioactive ingredients, such as ucuuba, murumuru and andiroba (all types of plant), enabling us to in- crease the proportion of these inputs in our soaps. The income received by the commu- nities during the year exceeded R$ 10 million. That is 55% higher than the amount received in 2015 and, in ad- dition to payment for supplies (R$ 5.8 million), it included the sharing of ben-2. efits derived from access to traditional knowledge (R$ 3.07 million), support for community infrastructure, training and payment for use of their image. 203-1 We have measured the positive im- pacts created by our relationship with local families, such as income gen- eration through the purchase of in- puts, investment in developing higher value-added production chains and transfer of technical skills through the training we provide. Now that they are much better organized, the communi- ties are entering into partnerships with other companies, as well as Natura, to supply inputs obtained from the Brazil- ian biodiversity. This development was achieved using a sustainable produc- tion and commercial model.\nWe have also invested in improving the productivity of these communities and adding value to their supplies, by upgrading the infrastructure of two extraction units (one in the Mid-Juru\u00e1 region and the other in the northeast of Par\u00e1) and thereby improving the quality to the oil and butter produced. We have continued with our training programs in the fields of health, safety, good management practices and or- ganization management, training 545 people in 2016.\nAlso in 2016, 100% of supplier commu- nities were audited by our Socio-bio- diversity Chain Verification System, developed jointly with the UEBT (Union for Ethical Biotrade). This procedure looks into labor issues, organization management and good production practices, and ensures the tracking of production chains, which is one of our\ngreatest challenges. This verification is ongoing, since the families need to de- velop a system to provide documenta- tion confirming the origin of all inputs. The audits are performed annually in each of the communities, generating action plans that are monitored until the next audit.\nOnce a year, the communities partici- pate in the Qlicar Award - which distin- guishes Natura suppliers - in the Bio- Qlicar category. The award goes to the most noteworthy community, the one that has shown the greatest evolution in several categories revolving around quality and good practices. The BioQli- car ratings underwent some changes in 2016, and the calculation now takes into consideration the ratings provided by the Verification System, as well as an indi- cator that measures the planned volume of production and delivery deadline.\nThe communities achieved a 3.93 rat- ing in 2016. This index, which used to be a part of BioQlicar but is now an element of the Verification System, ad- vanced slightly in comparison to the previous year\u2019s figure, of 3.62. The rat- ing is weighted, along with the OTIF (on time in full) assessment rating of the community. The improvement is due to the communities\u2019 improved audit rat- ings, as well as greater compliance with the action plans during 2016, which also increases the community\u2019s rating throughout the year. There was also an improvement in the OTIF rating, com- pared to 2015, due to better delivery planning, both by Natura and by the communities, and greater investment in chain infrastructure","Obs":"ok"}

Our team of researchers monitors the international discussions surrounding the growing use of each one by different industries, keeping a particularly watchful eye over the so-called controversial ingredients. When there is evidence that a sub- stance poses a risk to the environment or human health, Natura chooses to replace it in its formulas. ,  That is the case, for example, of Tri- closan, which is widely used in a variety of segments, such as cosmetics, ther- apeutic and veterinary products, and many more. Its function is to prevent or inhibit contamination by microor- ganisms (bacteria, fungi and yeasts). Its widespread use by many industries can lead, over the long term, to poten- tial environmental damage, due to its poor degradability. Studies also indi- cate that it has the potential to cause hormonal changes in humans. Acting proactively to ensure the safe- ty of our formulas, we have banned the use of Triclosan in the devel- opment of new products since July 2008, and are continually striving to replace it with new, less aggressive antibacterial ingredients that are more environmentally friendly, while preserving the safety and efficacy of our products. We have made prog- ress in this endeavor and in March 2016 we removed Triclosan altogeth- er from our product portfolio. Never- theless, it may still be possible to find products on the market containing this ingredient, since their expiration date ranges from two to four years from the manufacturing date. Phthalate and paraben are other controversial substances that have already been banned by Natura.Read more about our consumer safety procedures on page 134.","Obs":"ok"}

GRI  The main impacts related to leaks refer to soil and water contamination, for which the necessary measures were taken to minimize them. To avoid new occurrences, we adopted the following measures: review of motors and pumps involved in the accident in Jundia\u221a\u2260 and increased frequency of preventive maintenance; guidance to third parties to ensure preventive maintenance of vehicles; and diagnostics of all BRF storage tanks for hazardous products to identify their correct handling and safety procedures, necessary improvements and adjustments. GRI  We have impacts related to our partners that treat the waste generated, which is why we are constantly seeking partners that are increasingly committed to the environmental aspect in terms of transportation, treatment and final disposal of solid waste. Other points of impact occur in our integrated producers, where broilers and pigs are reared for slaughter, generating waste, such as poultry litter (wood shavings used for raising broilers, with animal manure), which, after being replaced, is sent for transformation into organic fertilizer. In the integrated producers of pigs, the main aspect is the generation of manure, which is properly treated and subsequently used for application in the soil, always with environmental authorization and monitoring by an agronomist.Cooperatives We created a development program that involves providing machinery and safety equipment to allow cooperative members to increase productivity and income.","Obs":"ok"}

The identified socio-environmental and economic impacts on the local communities of these territories are distinct, due to the different activities that we conduct in each locality. In the communities impacted by the mining activities, the main environmental impacts identified relate to deforestation to create space for the mining operation and dust caused by the movement of trucks transporting bauxite. To mitigate the impacts of the removal of vegetation for the extraction of the ore, we have a program to rehabilitate and recover the mined areas, developed in partnership with local universities, which guarantees that the soil is returned in good physical and chemical conditions for planting coffee, eucalyptus or pasture, or for the recomposition of the native vegetation (find out more about how we operate, on page 33). To mitigate dust levels, we have the practice of dampening the earth tracks used by the trucks loaded with bauxite and the mining machines. This dampening procedure is done using water tank trucks. Also, around the mines, we have equipment that control the air quality continually, enabling timely actions to be carried out in critical situations. To inform the local populations about our good management practices, we have developed an Environmental Education Program (EEP), with educational actions for the internal and external publics (see more on page 32). In the municipality of Alum\u221a\u2260nio, where our plant is located, we identified that one of the main impacts of our activities is the risk of economic dependence on the plant. To mitigate this risk, we invested in social projects that help to empower the local population. One such project is the ReDes Program, which promotes the strengthening of inclusive production chains capable of generating income for the community (see more on page 56). In terms of environmental impacts, the main aspects highlighted by the communities relate to the pruning of trees and conservation of areas of native forest that exist around the factory. We have a team that seeks to carry out this work in preventative form, but we also seek to act promptly when we receive notices and alerts from local residents. The communities impacted by our activities can access, via the institutional website of CBA, a communication channel where they can submit complaints. Other forms of learning about and evaluating the demands of society are reports received directly by the units, which are forwarded to the areas responsible, so that the necessary measures can be taken.419-1 | Amounts paid out in fines, infractions and judicial decisions relating to socio- economic aspects totaled R$19.1 million; of this figure, 99.6% relates to agreements and compensations for labor-related lawsuits.

In 2017, both schools were among the top-ranked institutions in the National High School Exam (ENEM, in Portuguese), and Juarez Wanderley was ranked 8 th in the state of S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo. In addition, more than 80% of their alumni were admitted to public universities across Brazil. Con- sidering those admitted in private universities with full scholarships, the rate of graduates who attend a college-level institution exceeds 90%. Some of these students receive financial sup- port from the Scholarship Fund, an initiative supported by contributions from businesses and individuals as well as from former grantees, whorefund the program after entering the job market. The Embraer Institute also provides finan- cial support to nonprofit social organizations, through the Social Partnership Program (PPS, in Portuguese). The initiative is aimed at sup- porting projects aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2017, it supported 12 organizations by investing up to R$40,000 per project. The entity also operates the Embraer Historic Center, whose purpose is to preserve and pro- mote the history of the Brazilian aviation industry. It currently has exhibition spaces at Embraer units, organizes virtual exhibits and monthly guided tours to the S\u221a\u00a3o Jos\u221a\u00a9 dos Campos man- ufacturing plant to community members.

The main initiatives include the Juarez Wan- derley (S\u221a\u00a3o Jos\u221a\u00a9 dos Campos, S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo) and Casimiro Montenegro Filho (Botucatu, S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo) schools, which offer free, full-time high school education to students coming from public schools and whose household income is lower than 9x the minimum monthly wage. Students also receive uniforms, textbooks, meals and transportation for the entire school year. In 2017, both schools were among the top-ranked institutions in the National High School Exam (ENEM, in Portuguese), and Juarez Wanderley was ranked 8 th in the state of S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo. In addition, more than 80% of their alumni were admitted to public universities across Brazil. Con- sidering those admitted in private universities with full scholarships, the rate of graduates who attend a college-level institution exceeds 90%. Some of these students receive financial sup- port from the Scholarship Fund, an initiative supported by contributions from businesses and individuals as well as from former grantees, whorefund the program after entering the job market. The Embraer Institute also provides finan- cial support to nonprofit social organizations, through the Social Partnership Program (PPS, in Portuguese). The initiative is aimed at sup- porting projects aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2017, it supported 12 organizations by investing up to R$40,000 per project. The entity also operates the Embraer Historic Center, whose purpose is to preserve and pro- mote the history of the Brazilian aviation industry. It currently has exhibition spaces at Embraer units, organizes virtual exhibits and monthly guided tours to the S\u221a\u00a3o Jos\u221a\u00a9 dos Campos man- ufacturing plant to community members. Some of the highlights of 2017 include the \u201a\u00c4\u00faDe- sign in Brazilian aviation\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 exhibit, which was at- tended by more than 40,000 visitors to the Museu da Casa Brasileira (MCB), in S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo. The Embraer Institute also earned the 2017 Aberje Award, the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leading corporate commu- nications award. The Institute was recognized by the Brazilian Association of Corporate Communi- cations (ABERJE, in Portuguese), in the Historical Responsibility and Business Memory category, for its efforts to preserve aeronautical memory over the course of the year. In 2017, the company created the Embraer Foun- dation, which consolidates all of the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s social initiatives in the United States. As is the case with the Institute in Brazil, the Foundation establishes social partnerships, engages employ- ees in volunteering programs and promotes an entrepreneurial culture among members of the communities served.

The other candidates were not approved and, therefore, did not become part of the supplier base of VCBR. We did not identify negative environmental impacts of the contracted suppliers in the evaluated period. GRI  Once approved, suppliers can participate in purchasing process- es. All VCBR negotiations are done digitally, in a transparent manner and with equality of conditions for the candidates. The negotiations are conducted by Procurement, and the technical aspects are evaluated by the respective operating areas or the Technical Department, depending on the characteristics of the product or service being purchased. All agreements are made in a way that always ensures that the decision provides the highest possible value for VCBR \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which goes beyond simply choosing the lowest price.Once hired, suppliers that provide services on a continuous basis are evaluated quarterly, against their performance, compliance to the scope of the agreement, and behavior in terms of safety. Evaluations are made by plant managers, and poor performers are called in for a review process that includes creation of an action plan. If the supplier continues to perform poorly in subsequent evaluations, it may be suspended and no longer be contracted for future work. In addition, the best-evaluated suppliers are certified as VC Partners. In 2017, we certified four suppliers as Gold (third consecutive year), six as Silver (second year) and nine as Bronze (first certification).","Obs":"ok"}
