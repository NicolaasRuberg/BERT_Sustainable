Of the total, 1,162 were evaluated for environmental risks, and 639 were approved and considered fit to work with us. The other candidates were not approved and, therefore, did not become part of the supplier base of VCBR. We did not identify negative environmental impacts of the contracted suppliers in the evaluated period. GRI  Once approved, suppliers can participate in purchasing process- es. All VCBR negotiations are done digitally, in a transparent manner and with equality of conditions for the candidates. The negotiations are conducted by Procurement, and the technical aspects are evaluated by the respective operating areas or the Technical Department, depending on the characteristics of the product or service being purchased. All agreements are made in a way that always ensures that the decision provides the highest possible value for VCBR \u201a\u00c4\u00ec which goes beyond simply choosing the lowest price.Once hired, suppliers that provide services on a continuous basis are evaluated quarterly, against their performance, compliance to the scope of the agreement, and behavior in terms of safety. Evaluations are made by plant managers, and poor performers are called in for a review process that includes creation of an action plan. If the supplier continues to perform poorly in subsequent evaluations, it may be suspended and no longer be contracted for future work. In addition, the best-evaluated suppliers are certified as VC Partners. In 2017, we certified four suppliers as Gold (third consecutive year), six as Silver (second year) and nine as Bronze (first certification).","Obs":"ok"}
