The main initiatives include the Juarez Wan- derley (S\u221a\u00a3o Jos\u221a\u00a9 dos Campos, S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo) and Casimiro Montenegro Filho (Botucatu, S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo) schools, which offer free, full-time high school education to students coming from public schools and whose household income is lower than 9x the minimum monthly wage. Students also receive uniforms, textbooks, meals and transportation for the entire school year. In 2017, both schools were among the top-ranked institutions in the National High School Exam (ENEM, in Portuguese), and Juarez Wanderley was ranked 8 th in the state of S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo. In addition, more than 80% of their alumni were admitted to public universities across Brazil. Con- sidering those admitted in private universities with full scholarships, the rate of graduates who attend a college-level institution exceeds 90%. Some of these students receive financial sup- port from the Scholarship Fund, an initiative supported by contributions from businesses and individuals as well as from former grantees, whorefund the program after entering the job market. The Embraer Institute also provides finan- cial support to nonprofit social organizations, through the Social Partnership Program (PPS, in Portuguese). The initiative is aimed at sup- porting projects aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2017, it supported 12 organizations by investing up to R$40,000 per project. The entity also operates the Embraer Historic Center, whose purpose is to preserve and pro- mote the history of the Brazilian aviation industry. It currently has exhibition spaces at Embraer units, organizes virtual exhibits and monthly guided tours to the S\u221a\u00a3o Jos\u221a\u00a9 dos Campos man- ufacturing plant to community members. Some of the highlights of 2017 include the \u201a\u00c4\u00faDe- sign in Brazilian aviation\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 exhibit, which was at- tended by more than 40,000 visitors to the Museu da Casa Brasileira (MCB), in S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo. The Embraer Institute also earned the 2017 Aberje Award, the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leading corporate commu- nications award. The Institute was recognized by the Brazilian Association of Corporate Communi- cations (ABERJE, in Portuguese), in the Historical Responsibility and Business Memory category, for its efforts to preserve aeronautical memory over the course of the year. In 2017, the company created the Embraer Foun- dation, which consolidates all of the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s social initiatives in the United States. As is the case with the Institute in Brazil, the Foundation establishes social partnerships, engages employ- ees in volunteering programs and promotes an entrepreneurial culture among members of the communities served.

The main initiatives include the Juarez Wan- derley (S\u221a\u00a3o Jos\u221a\u00a9 dos Campos, S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo) and Casimiro Montenegro Filho (Botucatu, S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo) schools, which offer free, full-time high school education to students coming from public schools and whose household income is lower than 9x the minimum monthly wage. Students also receive uniforms, textbooks, meals and transportation for the entire school year. In 2017, both schools were among the top-ranked institutions in the National High School Exam (ENEM, in Portuguese), and Juarez Wanderley was ranked 8 th in the state of S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo. In addition, more than 80% of their alumni were admitted to public universities across Brazil. Con- sidering those admitted in private universities with full scholarships, the rate of graduates who attend a college-level institution exceeds 90%. Some of these students receive financial sup- port from the Scholarship Fund, an initiative supported by contributions from businesses and individuals as well as from former grantees, whorefund the program after entering the job market. The Embraer Institute also provides finan- cial support to nonprofit social organizations, through the Social Partnership Program (PPS, in Portuguese). The initiative is aimed at sup- porting projects aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In 2017, it supported 12 organizations by investing up to R$40,000 per project. The entity also operates the Embraer Historic Center, whose purpose is to preserve and pro- mote the history of the Brazilian aviation industry. It currently has exhibition spaces at Embraer units, organizes virtual exhibits and monthly guided tours to the S\u221a\u00a3o Jos\u221a\u00a9 dos Campos man- ufacturing plant to community members. Some of the highlights of 2017 include the \u201a\u00c4\u00faDe- sign in Brazilian aviation\u201a\u00c4\u00f9 exhibit, which was at- tended by more than 40,000 visitors to the Museu da Casa Brasileira (MCB), in S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo. The Embraer Institute also earned the 2017 Aberje Award, the country\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s leading corporate commu- nications award. The Institute was recognized by the Brazilian Association of Corporate Communi- cations (ABERJE, in Portuguese), in the Historical Responsibility and Business Memory category, for its efforts to preserve aeronautical memory over the course of the year. In 2017, the company created the Embraer Foun- dation, which consolidates all of the company\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s social initiatives in the United States.
