In 2017, there was an increase in the absolute number and in the rate of injuries and diseases, partly due to adjustments pertaining to classifications of the legal aspects in each location. We also carried out several initiatives to reduce the severity rate of accidents.  Considering data for Brazil and Argentina, regions with the highest number of incidents, there was a 43% decrease in the severity rate for typical lost-time accidents and 28% for occupational diseases resulting in lost time when compared with 2016.  For 2018, we expect a 25% decrease in the absolute number of lost-time accidents (typical and commuting). GRI  Among the impacts associated with health and safety, above all is the loss of lives and\/or health of an employee, in addition to medical expenses, compensations and claim administration fees, indirect costs incurred due to damaged equipment and assets, loss of production and quality, interruption of processes, loss of revenue, workforce replacement, overtime, disputes, damages to customer relationship and to public image.The guidelines established and disseminated through the HSE Management System guide the definition of indicators and goals, as well as the commitment to continuous improvement and improved performance in health and safety. This system was revised in 2016 and is based on the Method; Behavior\/Culture; and Facilities\/ Infrastructure pillars. Among the main practices are the formal commitment from leadership, including goals linked to variable pay, clearly defined roles and responsibilities, committees, working groups, established standards and procedures, employees trained and qualified to perform their activities, health and safety dialogues and behavioral tools carried out by leadership, investigation of accidents and critical deviations, risk analysis and emergency response plan, among other tools.  In addition to the individual responsibility of working with prevention, all our employees must inform management of any risk condition they identify, ensuring everyone the right to question work conditions that do not comply with the Company's guidelines.","Obs":"ok"}
